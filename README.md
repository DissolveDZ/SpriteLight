# SpriteLight
2D/3D game-engine/framework using SDL2 and OpenGL <br>
Can be compiled statically and dynamically on Linux and Windows <br>
Now supports font rendering using freetype, working on SDF fonts and supplies a lot of useful functions like DrawSubText(), MeasureText() and more to come! <br>
The game engine syntax itself will involve functions to be called during the main loop like UpdateEngine() etc. to handle input and supply global struct pointer which contains all kinds of useful data like frame-time <br>
and an inbuilt camera system which can handle multiple camera types like panning etc.
